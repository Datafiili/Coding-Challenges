## -- Largest palindrome product -- #
#Written By: Aarni Junkkala

#Problem:
#A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
#The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
#Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

#My Thoughs:
#For this we need to test two numbers agains each other and reduce them till we reach 99.
#We will have to list all possible answers as 999 X 993 could be first working solution,
#but 998 x 998 is greater number, so we can't know witch is highest, before we know all of them.

#Note: This could have been done lot more dynamic.
